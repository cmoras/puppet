faced a good number of issues:

start with cleaning up all traces of the package from the sytem

   14  dpkg -l | grep puppet
   15  apt-get remove --purge puppet-agent puppet5-release puppetserver 
   16  apt-get clean
   17  deborphan
   18  apt install deborphan
   19  deborphan | xargs apt-get -y remove --purge
   20  apt-get clean
   21  dpkg -l | grep puppet



use the following section:

for server:
   25  lsb_release -a 
   26  wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet5-release-xenial.deb
   27  ls
   28  rm -rfv puppet5-release-xenial.deb 
   29  cd
   30  wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet5-release-xenial.deb
   31  ls
   32  rm -rfv puppet5-release-xenial.deb puppet5-release-xenial.deb.1 
   33  ls
   34  wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet5-release-xenial.deb
   35  ls
   36  dpkg -i puppet5-release-xenial.deb
   37  apt update
   38  export PATH=/opt/puppetlabs/bin:$PATH
   39  apt-get install puppetserver


for agent:
   91  lsb_release -a
   92  cd
   93  wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet5-release-xenial.deb
   94  ls
   95  rm -rfv puppet5-release-xenial.deb puppet5-release-xenial.deb.1 
   96  wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet5-release-xenial.deb
   97  dpkg -i puppet5-release-xenial.deb
   98  apt update
   99  export PATH=/opt/puppetlabs/bin:$PATH
  100  apt-get install puppet-agent

then proceed by making entries in /etc/hosts file in both for all of the associated nodes and agents
ip  hostname

^^ in that manner

Next test with "puppet agent -t" in the agent 

with this you should come across an output more or less like this:

/etc/puppetlabs/puppet# puppet agent --test
Warning: Unable to fetch my node definition, but the agent run will continue:
Warning: Failed to open TCP connection to puppet:8140 (getaddrinfo: Name or service not known)

So config changes need to be done. 
----------------------
change1: in /etc/hosts
-----------------------
for the puppetserver entry you also need to add puppet 
for instance

ip hostname,puppet
------------------------
change2: in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
------------------------
This is my puppet agent conf

root@apacemc3:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet# cat puppet.conf 
# This file can be used to override the default puppet settings.
# See the following links for more details on what settings are available:
# - https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_important_settings.html
# - https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_about_settings.html
# - https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_main.html
# - https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html

[main]
certname = apacemc3.mylabserver.com
server = puppet
environment = production
runinterval = 1m
root@apacemc3:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet# 




this is my puppet server conf

root@apacemc5:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet# cat puppet.conf 
# This file can be used to override the default puppet settings.
# See the following links for more details on what settings are available:

[main]
certname = apacemc5.mylabserver.com
server = puppet
environment = production
runinterval = 1m

[master]
dns_alt_names = apacemc5.mylabserver.com,puppet
vardir = /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver
logdir = /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver
rundir = /var/run/puppetlabs/puppetserver
pidfile = /var/run/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.pid
codedir = /etc/puppetlabs/code
root@apacemc5:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet# 
-------------------------------

Once this is done, you should get an output like 

root@apacemc3:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet# puppet agent --test
Info: Using configured environment 'production'
Info: Retrieving pluginfacts
Info: Retrieving plugin
Info: Retrieving locales
Info: Caching catalog for apacemc3.mylabserver.com
Info: Applying configuration version '1529928759'

else you can justgo ahead with 

root@apacemc3:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet# puppet agent --server apacemc5.mylabserver.com  --waitforcert 10 --test
Info: Using configured environment 'production'
Info: Retrieving pluginfacts
Info: Retrieving plugin
Info: Retrieving locales
Info: Caching catalog for apacemc3.mylabserver.com
Info: Applying configuration version '1529928218'
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.01 seconds

Any cmd parameters have higher priority.


next section is about certificate signing:
